<h1 align="center">Vibrant Night</h1>
<p align="center">A cozy colorscheme for all my things!</p>

This is a simple colorscheme that I've designed for myself and will implement for the things I use. Screenshots might change with time as I improve themes.

I am going to implement this theme for the following:

	* st
	* dwm
	* tmux
	* vim
	* $PS1

Once these are finished I might create simple implementations for the following:

	* Chromium (use ungoogled chromium or you're a clown)
	* Firefox
	* discord? (maybe)
